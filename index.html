<h2>Many of us like to share news and stories on social media with our friends.</h2> 
<p>We all share things for different reasons. Perhaps it's an interesting story, news about a celebrity that you like, or something that made you laugh.</p>
<p>But when you see something you like online, do you check to make sure that it's true before you share it?</p>
<p>Not everything that we read or see on the internet is true - and if it isn't, and we share it, we could be making more people believe something that is actually made up.</p>
<p>Stories like this are called fake news and they can be a problem.</p>

<h3>What is fake news?</h3>
<p>Fake news is news or stories on the internet that are not true.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of fake news:</p>
<p>1. False stories that are deliberately published or sent around, in order to make people believe something untrue or to get lots of people to visit a website. These are deliberate lies that are put online, even though the person writing them knows that they are made up.</p>
<p>2. Stories that may have some truth to them, but they're not completely accurate. This is because the people writing them - for example, journalists or bloggers - don't check all of the facts before publishing the story, or they might exaggerate some of it.</p>
<p>It is happening a lot at the moment, with many people publishing these stories in order to get as many shares as possible.</p>
