<h2>Bad side of fake news.</h2> 
<p>With fake news, there are a lot of fake rumors that can be spread from fake news and some can be misleading and taken too far.</p>
<p>Examples would be fake celebrities news, or fake events or news in general which can cause to mislead many people wihtout giving too much clear information.</p>
<p>Not everything that we read or see on the internet is true - and if it isn't, and we share it, we could be making more people believe something that is actually made up.</p>
<p>Stories like this are called fake news and they can be a problem.</p>

<h3>Ways to spot fake news</h3>
<p>There are some ways to spot fake news:</p>
<p>1. Some published news may not have sources and not enough info to say where it came from and who made it, this is one of the ways to spot fake news.</p>
<p>2. Other fake news published may have fake images or pictures to convince people that their information is real, so it is good to check if the image is real of not, or randomly taken from the internet.</p>
<p> Lastly, it is always good to check what other people might have recieved from their news compared to yours and see if it accurate or completely different and innacurate.</p>
